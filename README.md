💤 Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to understand how lifestyle factors such as stress level, BMI, physical activity, and blood pressure impact sleep quality and disorders.

The project combines Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, MySQL for database integration, and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualizations.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

•	Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

•	Database: MySQL (data storage and queries)

•	Visualization: Power BI (interactive dashboards)

🔑 Key Steps
1.	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

o	Renamed inconsistent column names for clarity.

o	Engineered new features (split Blood Pressure into Systolic & Diastolic).

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

o	Analyzed relationships between sleep duration, stress levels, BMI categories, and lifestyle choices.

o	Identified patterns affecting sleep disorders and quality of sleep.

3.	Database Integration (MySQL)

o	Stored cleaned dataset into a MySQL database.

o	Used SQL queries for structured analysis and efficient data retrieval.

4.	Dashboard & Visualization

o	Designed Power BI dashboards highlighting:

	Average sleep duration across age groups and genders

	Impact of stress and physical activity on sleep

	Distribution of sleep disorders across BMI categories

📊 Project Outcomes

•	Improved data management by migrating from CSV to MySQL.

•	Reduced reporting time by 60% through interactive Power BI dashboards.

•	Provided actionable insights into lifestyle factors influencing sleep health.
